== Introduction

[%hardbreaks]
The link:https://llvm.org/[LLVM] Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies.
Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines.
The name "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.
